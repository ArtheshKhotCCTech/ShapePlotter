This project is a simple Shape Plotter written in C++ that allows users to input coordinates of a shape's vertices. 
The program saves these coordinates to a .dat file, which can then be visualized using Gnuplot, a powerful plotting tool. 
The goal of this project is to provide a way for users to plot custom shapes and visualize them through Gnuplot by generating .dat files for plotting.
